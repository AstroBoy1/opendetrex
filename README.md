## Introduction

detrex is an open-source toolbox that provides state-of-the-art Transformer-based detection algorithms. It is built on top of [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) and its module design is partially borrowed from [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) and [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr). Many thanks for their nicely organized code. The main branch works with **Pytorch 1.10+** or higher (we recommend **Pytorch 1.12**).

<summary> Major Features </summary>

- **Modular Design.** detrex decomposes the Transformer-based detection framework into various components which help users easily build their own customized models.

- **State-of-the-art Methods.** detrex provides a series of Transformer-based detection algorithms, including [DINO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03605) which reached the SOTA of DETR-like models with **63.3AP**!

- **Easy to Use.** detrex is designed to be **light-weight** and easy for users to use:
  - [LazyConfig System](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/lazyconfigs.html) for more flexible syntax and cleaner config files.
  - Light-weight [training engine](./tools/train_net.py) modified from detectron2 [lazyconfig_train_net.py](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/main/tools/lazyconfig_train_net.py)

Apart from detrex, we also released a repo [Awesome Detection Transformer](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/awesome-detection-transformer) to present papers about Transformer for detection and segmentation.
